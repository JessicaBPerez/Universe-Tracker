Oxygen attacked many of life' s molecules, when oxygen fused with these molecules, it changing their molecular structure and produced carbon dioxide and heat as a byproduct.

    eventDescription: "Our current carbon dioxide emissions are too great for photosynthesis producting plants and organisms to handle. Effects directly significant to humans are predicted to include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields, and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels. Environmental impacts appear likely to include the extinction or relocation of ecosystems as they adapt to climate change, with coral reefs, mountain ecosystems, and Arctic ecosystems most immediately threatened. Because the climate system has a large inertia and greenhouse gases will remain in the atmosphere for a long time, climatic changes and their effects will continue to become more pronounced for many centuries even if further increases to greenhouse gases stop.",

The dark energy, in conjuction with dark matter, all of the celestial bodies and objects will be carried away from each other by gravitational forces.
