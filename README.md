# Universe Tracker

General Assembly WDI 20 - Project 3

- Project: https://secret-shore-95894.herokuapp.com/
- Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/yGcFqFMT/constellation-tracker-app
- Git Hub: https://github.com/JessicaBPerez/Universe-Tracker.git

## Overview

The goal of this project was to utilize our knowledge of React, the Mongo database, node packages, and libraries to build and style an interactive web application that permanently stores data in a database. We then render, create, edit, or delete new data to make our app interactive. My app is called "Universe Tracker." It is an educational app that displays nine facts about our known universe. Users have the option to edit or delete a fact on the main page, and add additional comments / facts of their own in subsequent pages. Users also have access to a real-time weather tracker that will display the current weather in addtion to weather for the next three days using an OpenWeather API call. The weather also automatically updates every three hours. As an added bonus, users can view the photographs that the Curiosity Rover captures of Mars, in addition to having access to Nasa's "Pic of the Day" that automaticallu updates daily.
